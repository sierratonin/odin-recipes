                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The crispiest garlicky butter parmesan fries made at home and even better! 
                    The fries have that perfect crispy exterior and the most fluffy potato texture on the inside. 
                    After fried to crispy golden perfection, 
                    they're tossed in a garlic and herb butter that is just too good not to lick the plate clean.
                </p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 large Russet potatoes</li>
                    <li>2 to 3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon parsley finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon garlic finely minced</li>
                    <li>2 to 3 tablespoons parmesan grated</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>To a small bowl, add the melted butter, parsley, garlic, parmesan, salt, 
                        black pepper, and oregano. Mix together and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Rinse and peel the potatoes completely.</li>
                    <li>Cut each potato vertically into rectangular slices, about 1/4 inch thick. 
                        Then stack them on top of each other and cut across to make the signature fry shape, 
                        also 1/4 inch. I like to make them thin but you can as thin or as thick as you'd like.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a bowl filled with ice and water and let it soak for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain the ice water and rinse the potatoes 2 to 3 times, 
                        shaking them around well to get rid of any excess starch.</li>
                    <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot and add the potatoes in. Boil just for 5 to 6 minutes. 
                        You don't want them to be soft where they break. 
                        We are just par-boiling to help achieve that crispy layer.</li>
                    <li>Pat the fries completely dry and add them to a tray or large bowl. 
                        Sprinkle the cornstarch and shake around so each one is coated evenly.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat until the oil reaches about 250°F. 
                        You don't want to be the oil to be that hot for the first fry.</li>
                    <li>Add the French fries and flash fry for 3 to 5 minutes. 
                        They will not be golden but they'll hold their shape well. 
                        Fry in batches so the pan is not over-crowded.</li>
                    <li>Get the oil hotter now, about 350°F. Add the fries back in and fry until 
                        beautifully golden and crispy, 
                        making sure to move them around so they evenly brown and crisp up.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a wire rack to drain any excess oil. Sprinkle a little bit of salt.</li>
                    <li>Add to a bowl along with the garlic butter. Toss around so the fries are coated evenly. 
                        Taste and adjust salt if needed.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
